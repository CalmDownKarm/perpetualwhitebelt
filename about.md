My name is Karmanya Aggarwal, I'm currently a developer at Gramener working out of New Delhi, India. I'm also a research assistant at IIIT Delhi's MIDAS Group, that looks at applications of machine learning on Social Media. 

This blog is to help me organize my thoughts, help hold myself accountable to goals that I set, chronicle my side projects and just about everything in between. 

Most things I post here will have code samples on my [github](https://github.com/calmdownkarm)

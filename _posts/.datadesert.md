The other day, I was helping out some people at my research lab write a couple of sentiment analysis classifiers for the Hindi Language and I was surprised to find that almost every famous English Language Model(Glove, FastText, Word2vec) has a Hindi equivalent that is very easy to find. I was even more surprised to find despite this, there is a dearth of well put together datasets for modern NLP Tasks. 

It's not like people in India haven't been working on NLP Tasks - far from it and amazing people, much smarter than me at IIT Bombay and other big name universities have done a lot in terms of rules based parsing, releasing corpora, entity extraction tools and a bunch of things which I barely understand. That being said, thanks to Jio and its ilk, the hindi side of the internet is growing at insane rates right now - and there doesn't seem to be enough attention towards building datasets for sentiment analysis, document classification or sequence to sequence models. 

That said, why not build a few? This essentially boils down to building a tool that lets people annotate a bunch of text data, and then incentivising people to use it.

My name is Karmanya Aggarwal, I'm currently a developer at Gramener in Hyderabad, India. For most things my language of choice is Python.

This blog is to help me organize my thoughts, help hold myself accountable to goals that I set, chronicle my side projects and just about everything in between. 

Most things I post here will have code samples on my [github](https://github.com/calmdownkarm)

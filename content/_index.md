My name is Karmanya Aggarwal. I'm a machine learning engineer and researcher. This means I spend most of my time complaining about my lack of compute. 

I'm currently working on getting my masters from The University of Pennsylvania and a research assistant with Duncan Watt's Lab at Penn, where I'm working to make the methods used in computational social science more rigorous. 

In the past I've worked at [Gramener](https://gramener.com/), IIIT Delhi's [MIDAS Research Lab](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) and [DoctorC](https://doctorc.in/)


This is my corner of the internet, and will essentially host a bunch of random things I think about, and occasionally some technical things as well.


The title of this website reflects my progress in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu - where I'm the only person I know that needed to get knee surgery before I got a blue belt. I go by calmdownkarm on most platforms. Feel free to email me if you want to chat about NLP or social media.

Shoutout to [Brady Salz](bradysalz.com) from whom I'm stealing most of this website

My name is Karmanya Aggarwal. I'm a "Data Scientist" which basically means I write a lot of back end code and occasionally import one of either scikit-learn or torch.

I'm currently on sabbatical from [Gramener](https://gramener.com/), and a full time research assistant at IIIT Delhi's [MIDAS Research Lab](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) where I try and understand how people use social media and try to teach computers to understand language.

I've also been working with the Delhi Government to create some [good governance dashboards](http://www.aaptracker.in/).

This is my corner of the internet, and will essentially host a bunch of random things I think about, and occasionally some technical things as well.

The title of this website reflects my progress in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu - where I'm the only person I know that needed to get knee surgery before I got a blue belt. I go by calmdownkarm on most platforms. Feel free to email me if you want to chat about NLP or social media.

Shoutout to [Brady Salz](bradysalz.com) from whom I'm stealing most of this website

I'm going to preface this by saying I know very little about politics.

However, irrespective of your view of the legality of CAB and NRC - the steps that The Indian Government is taking to quell these protests are completely inexcusable. 

Shutting down Metro Stations, Imposing Section 144 and Preventing Internet/Mobile Access to prevent peaceful protests is excessive and should be illegal.

At the moment, There is no internet in parts of UP - Sahranpur, Muzaffarnagar, Aligarh and Sambhal. Entire States of Assam and Meghalya have no access and it doesn't seem likely that Kashmir will get access restored any time soon. 

Parts of Delhi have no access, but being that it's a major metropolitan, that's unlikely to remain true indefinitely.


Kushal Das has this [excellent blog post](https://kushaldas.in/posts/indian-police-attacked-university-campuses-on-government-order.html) that talks about all the crazy shit the government is doing.

Join the protests if possible. Donate to organizations supporting the protestors if possible. I don't know if it makes any difference eventually, but fuck waiting around to find out.

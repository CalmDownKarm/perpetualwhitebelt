My name is Karmanya Aggarwal, I'm currently a developer at Gramener in Hyderabad, India. For most things my language of choice is Python.

This blog is primarily intended to chronicle what I learn about machine learning, my experiments with data visualization in my downtime and various side projects that get involved in.

Most things I post here will have code samples on my [github](https://github.com/calmdownkarm)
